## Code Explanation:

### 1. The code starts by printing a message that states the rules of the game.
### 2. The first line in the code prints “Rock vs paper->paper wins.”
### 3. This is because if you have a rock, and you play against someone who has a piece of paper, the rock will beat the paper.
### 4. The next line in the code prints “Rock vs scissor->Rock wins.”
### 5. This is because if you have a rock, and you play against someone who has a scissors, the rock will beat the scissors.
### 6. The last line in the code prints “paper vs scissor->scissor wins.”
### 7. This is because if you have a piece of paper, and you play against someone who has a scissors, then the piece of paper will beat the scissors.
### 8. The code will print the following output: Winning Rules of the Rock paper scissor game as follows: Rock vs paper->paper wins Rock vs scissor->Rock wins paper vs scissor->scissor wins
### 9. The code starts by asking the user for a choice.
### 10. The code then checks to see if the input is 1, 2, or 3.
### 11. If it is not one of those values, the code sets the choice_name variable to ‘Rock’ if choice == 1, ‘paper’ if choice == 2, and ‘scissor’ if choice == 3.
### 12. The next part of the code asks the user for their computer turn.
### 13. The code uses a random number generator to choose between 1, 2, and 3.
### 14. This value is stored in comp_choice_name.
### 15. Next, the code loops until comp_choice equals choice.
### 16. In each loop iteration, comp_choice will be randomly chosen from 1-3 and stored in comp_choice_name.
### 17. Once comp_choice equals choice, this means that the computer has chosen rock as its turn!
### 18. Finally, it prints out both choices so that everyone can see what happened (user choice is: Rock V/s paper; Computer choice is: Rock V/s scissor).
### 19. The code will ask the user for a choice between rock, paper and scissors.
### 20. Once the user enters their choice, the code will randomly choose one of those options as the computer’s turn.
### 21. The code then prints out the chosen option and the user’s choice.
### 22. Finally, it loops back to ask for another choice from the user.
